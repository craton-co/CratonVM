# The optimizing tier's coverage, measured 2026-08-03

Every number the `cov-*` lanes are sized from. One run each, ten workloads,
**default configuration** — no `CRATONVM_JIT_FORCE_C2`, no flags beyond the
Spring Boot runner's usual `CRATONVM_JIT=rootsnap-cache`.

Reproduce with `CRATONVM_DBG=ir-compiles`, which prints one `[ir] admission`
line per compile request with the verdict, and one `[ir] optimizing backend
produced a body` line per success. Both are ungated by `metrics::enabled()`.

## Headline

**The optimizing tier runs, and 41% of what it admits it cannot lower.**

| | |
|---|---:|
| compile requests reaching the admission chain | 1,954 |
| …refused `optimize=false` (a C1 request — normal tiering, not a gap) | 719 |
| …refused by `ir_compatible` before the builder saw them | 248 |
| **admitted to the optimizing pipeline** | **982** |
| **bodies the optimizing backend actually produced** | **592** |
| admitted but never lowered | **390** |
| distinct methods admitted / with a body | 848 / 497 |

`optimize=false` is **not** a defect and no lane targets it:
`tier_uses_optimized_backend` is `matches!(tier, C2 | FullProfile)`, so a
`false` here is a C1 request doing exactly what tiering says. C2 was asked for
982 times out of 1,954 — the request rate is healthy. The loss is downstream.

## Per workload

| workload | requests | admitted | `optimize=false` | `ir_compatible` | bodies |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `ConditionalOnPropertyTests` | 1,372 | 694 | 537 | 140 | 409 |
| `AutoConfigurationSorterTests` | 352 | 182 | 98 | 72 | 123 |
| `ConditionalOnClassTests` | 223 | 103 | 84 | 36 | 58 |
| **CratonBench, all seven phases** | **7** | **3** | **3** | **1** | **2** |

That last row is `meas-02`. The CPU benchmark suite — the thing the perf gate
measures and the README table publishes — issues **seven** compile requests to
the optimizing tier across all seven phases and gets **two** bodies. Every
conclusion this project has drawn about C2 from a CratonBench number was drawn
from a workload that does not reach it.

## Where the 390 die: opcodes `IrBuilder::build` has no arm for

273 events. `[ir] IrBuilder::build has no lowering for opcode 0xNN`.

| opcode | mnemonic | events | lane |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `0xb2` | `getstatic` | 92 | `cov-01` |
| `0x12` | `ldc` | 90 | `cov-01` |
| `0xbe` | `arraylength` | 43 | `cov-02` |
| `0x32` | `aaload` | 18 | `cov-02` |
| `0x13` | `ldc_w` | 7 | `cov-01` |
| `0x5a` | `dup_x1` | 6 | `cov-02` |
| `0x33` | `baload` | 6 | `cov-02` |
| `0x34` | `caload` | 5 | `cov-02` |
| `0x2e` | `iaload` | 3 | `cov-02` |
| `0x54` | `bastore` | 2 | `cov-02` |
| `0xbc` | `newarray` | 1 | `cov-06` |

`getstatic` + `ldc`/`ldc_w` is **189 of 273 — 69%** of every opcode gap.

### The asymmetry worth staring at

`IrBuilder::build` **does** have arms for `0x30 faload`, `0x31 daload`,
`0x51 fastore`, `0x52 dastore`. It has arms for **no** integral or reference
array access: not `iaload`, not `baload`, not `caload`, not `aaload`, not
`bastore`.

A float array element can be lowered and an `int[]` element cannot. That is not
a design decision anybody would defend out loud; it is the shape of the
fixtures the arms were written against. It is also precisely the failure mode
this directory's own closeout rule names — *"Do not size a lane from a
fixture's node mix"* — showing up in the code rather than in a plan.

## Where the rest die: structural refusals inside the builder

112 events. `[ir] IrBuilder::build refused at ir.rs:NNNN (bytecode pc N)`.

| site | what it is | events | lane |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `ir.rs:5204` | `invokespecial` that is neither a resolvable call nor a trivial `<init>` to elide | 53 | `cov-04` |
| `ir.rs:5085` | `putfield` whose type tag is not `I/Z/B/C/S` — **every reference field store** | 37 | `cov-03` |
| `ir.rs:5264` | an invoke with no `invoke_info` at that pc | 13 | `cov-04` |
| `ir.rs:5041` | `getfield` of a `long`/`float`/`double` | 6 | `cov-03` |
| `ir.rs:5314` | — | 2 | `cov-04` |
| `ir.rs:5219` | — | 1 | `cov-04` |

`ir.rs:5085` is the second asymmetry. The `getfield` arm was taught to handle
reference fields, and its own comment records why: *"This was the single largest
builder refusal measured on a real workload (66 of 141 on a Hibernate class): a
reference field read is most of what object-oriented Java does."* The `putfield`
arm twenty lines below it was not given the same treatment, and a reference
field **write** is most of what object-oriented Java does too.

## The whole-method refusals, before the builder runs

583 events, from `ir_compatible` (`jit/src/ir.rs:6066`). These methods never
enter the builder at all, so they are absent from the 273 and the 112 above.

| conjunct | events | lane |
|---|---:|---|
| `!scan.typecheck_ops.is_empty()` (`checkcast` / `instanceof`) | 306 | `cov-05` |
| `!scan.anewarray_ops.is_empty()` (`0xbd`) | 138 | `cov-06` |
| `scan.has_athrow` | 89 | `cov-07` |
| `!scan.indy_ops.is_empty()` | 44 | — |
| `scan.field_ops.len() > IR_MAX_FIELD_OPS` | 4 | — |
| `!scan.multianewarray_ops.is_empty()` | 2 | `cov-06` |

`indy` has no lane on purpose: `invokedynamic`'s single-pass lowering is an
unconditional trap that publishes a resume snapshot, and giving the IR tier a
second lowering for it is a much larger question than the 44 events justify.
Write it up before starting it, not after.

## What this survey does NOT say

* Nothing here is a **timing**. Every number is a count, so the loaded host
  (1-min load 10–14 throughout) does not affect it. No conclusion about speed
  can be drawn from this file.
* It does not say lowering these opcodes makes anything **faster**. It says the
  optimizing tier declines to compile 41% of what it admits. Whether an
  optimized body beats the single-pass one for a given method is a separate
  measurement, and `docs/internal/performance/` has at least one case where it
  did not (`reference_c2_tier_slower_because_fields_take_the_helper`).
* Nine of the ten workloads are Spring-shaped. The bench phases are the only
  counter-sample and they are the row that reaches nothing, so the opcode
  ranking above is a **Spring** ranking. A lane that wants to claim a general
  ranking should add a second family — H2 or Tomcat — before quoting these
  numbers as the ordering.
