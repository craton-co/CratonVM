## Resolved (2026-07-27)

Both major clusters from the 2026-07-26 "passed"-category regression spike (248 FAIL, up from
single digits) cleared after merging `origin/dev` commit `13055f75c` ("fix(jit): String
compact-layout field offsets and the branch-join reload mirror") and rebuilding:

- `MappingXsdSupport.<clinit>` `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` cluster (113 classes) — root-caused
  and FIXED (compact-ref-fields JIT regression in the class-init path).
  112/113 confirmed passing after the fix; the 1 straggler (`ScannerTest`) now fails on an
  unrelated pre-existing timeout, not this bug.
- `TableGroupJoinProducer.createTableGroupJoin` `NullPointerException` cluster (20 classes) — never
  formally root-caused (investigation was killed by an API rate limit before writing a doc), but
  confirmed resolved incidentally by the same merge: 20/20 now PASS. No doc was written since no
  root cause was ever captured.
