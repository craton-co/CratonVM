## It is NOT the defect that was fixed three times

Every lever the previous three writeups turned is inert now. This matters more
than any single row: the 08-01 page closed on a differential
(`CRATONVM_NO_MOVING_YOUNG` flipping PASS/FAIL), and that differential is gone.

| lever | 08-01 behaviour | now |
|---|---|---|
| `CRATONVM_NO_MOVING_YOUNG=1` | flipped baseline FAIL → PASS | **still FAIL** |
| `CRATONVM_NO_MIRROR_PIN_YOUNG_DEFER=1` | flipped fixed PASS → FAIL | **still FAIL** |
| `--nojit` | PASS | **still FAIL** |
| `-Xmx` (promotion timing, the 07-14 mechanism) | — | 2g / 512m / 256m all FAIL |

`--nojit` failing removes the entire JIT-root family the 07-27 fix addressed.
The heap-size rows remove the promotion-timing accident 07-14 and 07-27 both
describe. The 08-01 predicate is intact and *working*: measured
`conditional_metadata=true` and the evicted mirror is `DEFERRED`, i.e. left out
of the unconditional root set exactly as intended.

## The bisect

`git bisect run`, 10 steps over 1100 revisions, `638bd1190` (the 08-01 fix) as
the good endpoint — **verified PASS on this fixture** rather than trusted from
the 08-01 page's recorded result. Five commits were SKIPped legitimately (build
failures, and one commit that died with an unrelated `langtagSets` NPE — the
run script's third arm, exit 125, so a broken build could not be miscounted as
BAD and point the bisect at the wrong commit).

```
good  af2105aa6  feat(gc,vm): the identity hash now lives in the mark word, end to end
BAD   1d2817c75  feat(types,gc,vm,jit): delete identity_hash_code from ObjectHeader
```

The switchover to the mark word is **good**; deleting the header field is bad.
That is worth stating explicitly because the opposite is the natural guess.

## What is measured, and what it rules out

All from the failing run, via `CRATONVM_DBG_MIRRORPIN=1 CRATONVM_DBG_MIRRORPIN_WHY=1`
(this branch wires callers for `VmHeap::root_held_paths` / `find_referrers`,
which had existed since the doc-26 round with **no call sites at all**):

| question | answer |
|---|---|
| Is the mirror in the unconditional root set? | No — `deferrable=true => DEFERRED` |
| Does any heap field reference the mirror? | No — `root_held_paths=1`, the target itself |
| Does any heap field reference its loader? | No — same |
| Does a live activation root the loader (frame / JIT)? | No — no `root via FRAME`/`JIT_ACTIVATION` for any JSP class |
| Does `loader_pin` pin it from a live instance? | No — `live_instances_of_this_loader=0` |
| How many non-moving young sweeps run? | Exactly **1**, the `System.gc()` — the intended path |
| Which liveness arm calls the mirror live? | `region=young old_gen_allocated=false young_survivor=true` |

Two traps in reading those rows, both of which cost a round of investigation:

* **"Zero heap referrers" is not evidence of a direct root.** instance→class is
  the header's `class_id` and instance→loader is the `loader_pin` side table;
  neither is a ref slot, so neither appears in a referrer walk. The mirror
  having no referrer is the EXPECTED state, not a finding.
* **`young_survivor=true` is not a wrong verdict.**
  `is_live_young_survivor` is `word0 != 0` — it reports whether the sweep
  zeroed the span, and never consults a mark bit. So for a young object
  `is_marked` is a faithful reporter of what the MARKER decided. The verdict
  is right; the marking is what needs explaining.

Also eliminated:

* **Overlay over-rooting (`roots.rs` step 17).** The long comment at
  `gc_and_alloc.rs:2062` documents this as an unfixed deeper bug that retains
  exactly this JSP cluster ("21 direct hits"). It has since been gated:
  `native_roots::scan_collection_overlays` skips the unconditional scan when
  `major_gc_requested()` under Generational, which is precisely this test's
  path. Still unconditional for **ZGC** and G1, which may be why ZGC fails —
  but it cannot be the default-collector mechanism. **The comment is stale and
  should be corrected when this closes.**
* **The plausibility-screen hole `1d2817c75` shipped red.** Its own message
  predicted Stage 3 (HEADER_SIZE 16) would close it, and it did:
  `mark_and_push_rescues_a_walked_base_the_plausibility_screen_rejects` passes
  on dev.

## The open question

Something in the young non-moving marker marks the evicted JSP's `ClassLoader`,
with no root, no heap referrer and no `loader_pin` instance — and it started
doing so when the identity hash left the header. The commit's own message names
the mechanism class:

> The stale-pointer detector and the zeroed-region screens keyed on "a fresh
> header is never all-zero, because a hash is stamped at allocation". That
> premise is dead: the hash is lazy now... The predicates were rewritten onto
> the mark word and each says at the site that it is WEAKER, not equivalent.

The next step is to instrument the young marker's mark REASON for the loader
address (the old-gen BFS already threads reason strings — `loader_pin`,
`mirror_pin`, `metadata_pin`, `external-overlay`; the young marker does not),
rather than to keep eliminating root sources from the outside.

## Do not close this without a regression pin

Three prior fixes, three recurrences, and the 08-01 page's own lesson was that
the predicate it repaired **had no test**, which is how a one-line default flip
disarmed it in silence. Whatever closes this needs a vector that runs in
`regression-suite` — not a `probes/` reproducer that nothing schedules.
