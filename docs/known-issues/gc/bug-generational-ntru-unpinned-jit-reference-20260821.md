# The ntru unpinned-JIT-reference failure now reproduces on GENERATIONAL

## What is failing

`org.bouncycastle.pqc.math.ntru.test.PolynomialTest` under
`-XX:+UseGenerationalGC`, on **pristine `dev`**:

```text
gen-devpure-1  FAIL  IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.Object
gen-devpure-2  FAIL  IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.Object
gen-devpure-3  FAIL  IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.Object
```

That is the signature of `bug-g1-evacuates-live-jit-reference-20260819.md` — a
live reference the collector's root set did not contain, read back stale after
the object moved — but on a **different collector** and a different test method
(`testSqToBytes` in one run, `testS3FromBytes` in the G1 case).

## This is not the G1 branch's doing

Measured with the branch that fixed the G1 case applied, and without it, three
runs each, same host, same fixture:

| build | generational |
|---|---|
| pristine `dev@cae49a85c` | FAIL 3/3 |
| `dev@cae49a85c` + the G1 root-coverage branch | FAIL 3/3 |

Identical. The G1 fixes neither cause nor address it. (Under G1 on the same
tips: pristine FAIL 2/2, branch PASS 2/2 — that half is fixed and landed.)

## The regression window, stated honestly

The window is **`684f37e14..cae49a85c`**, and it is wider than it first looked.

What was actually measured passing under generational was a binary built from
`684f37e14` (my branch point, pristine) — `PASS`, with the collector reporting
`incomplete=true` on all 8 collections, so it never took the precise-only
suppression at all. **Pristine `dev@8d5e26cf9` was never run under
generational**, so the tempting narrower claim ("it broke in dev's last 41
commits") is not supported by anything measured. Do not repeat it without
bisecting.

That leaves roughly 240 commits in the window.

## The bisect was attempted and is VOID

`git bisect run` over `684f37e14..cae49a85c`, probe = build + run, matching the
exception signature rather than the exit code, two passes required for "good":

```text
BAD  end (cae49a85c)  exit=0   <- the endpoint should have been BAD
GOOD end (684f37e14)  exit=0
78606e45d  BAD  (run1=PASS run2=SIG - flaky)
…                                   walked to 819ad679a
```

**The BAD endpoint passed, so the run proves nothing** and `819ad679a` is not a
result. With an intermittent failure a two-run pass cannot establish "good" —
any commit can pass twice by chance — so every GOOD verdict in that trace is
unsound, and the bisect walked a tree of unreliable answers to a confident
conclusion. Do not cite it.

## The rate, measured — and it IS a regression

Ten runs per endpoint, interleaved so host load lands on both equally:

```text
bad  cae49a85c   SIG=7  PASS=3     ~70% per run
good 684f37e14   SIG=0  PASS=10    0/10, never reproduced
```

Two things follow.

**The regression is real.** The good end is clean in ten runs, so this is not a
long-standing intermittent defect that was always present — something inside
`684f37e14..cae49a85c` introduced it. That was the question that decided whether
bisecting is meaningful at all.

**The void bisect is explained arithmetically, not vaguely.** At 70% per run,
two consecutive passes occur 0.3² = **9%** of the time. The first probe required
exactly two passes to call a commit good, so it carried a 9% chance of
mislabelling *any* bad commit — and it spent that on the endpoint check. Nothing
about the host or the tooling was wrong; the probe was simply under-powered for
the rate, and the rate had not been measured.

The re-run uses **six** consecutive clean passes for GOOD (0.3⁶ ≈ 0.07% per
step, ~0.6% over eight steps) and exits on the first signature, so bad commits
stay cheap and only genuinely good ones pay the full six.

A GOOD verdict still means "did not reproduce in six", not proof: if the failure
rate collapses near the introduction point, six passes buys less than that
arithmetic suggests. Whatever commit the search names should be confirmed by
re-running it and its parent directly, rather than trusting the walk.

## What the failing run shows

The collector is repeatedly *declining* to move, which is the safe direction,
and failing anyway:

```text
[moving-young] fallback #3: reason=unregistered-jit-frame-on-stack
[moving-young] fallback #4: reason=compiled-frame-oop-not-published
[moving-young] fallback #5..#8: reason=compiled-frame-oop-not-published
```

`compiled-frame-oop-not-published` is `incomplete_reason::UNPUBLISHED_FRAME_OOP`.
It is **not** new and not from the G1 branch — it is present in both `684f37e14`
and `dev`, introduced by `ba2c417af` ("the frame-band verifier must not pass
vacuously").

The tension worth chasing: a non-moving sweep does not relocate anything, so a
stale JIT slot should be impossible on those cycles. Either a cycle that did
*not* fall back is the one that corrupts, or the damage is not a relocation at
all. That distinction is the first thing to establish — the fallback log is
evidence about the cycles that were safe, not about the one that was not.

Also present, immediately before the failure:

```text
JIT compile bailed: code buffer estimate too small; retrying at the measured size
  method="…/PolynomialTest.testSqToBytes:()V" code_len=341 capacity=67552 wanted=67957
```

Whether a recompile of the very method that then fails is coincidence or
mechanism is unknown; it is recorded because it is one line above the failure,
not because there is a story for it.

## Repro

```bash
cd /data/cratonvm/apps/bc-java
cratonvm --java-home /data/toolchain/jdk-25 -XX:+UseGenerationalGC --Xmx 1g \
    -Dbc.test.data.home=/data/cratonvm/apps/bc-test-data \
    -Dtest.java.version.prefix=25 \
    -c "$(cat /data/bcjca-classpath.txt)" \
    junit.textui.TestRunner org.bouncycastle.pqc.math.ntru.test.PolynomialTest
```

**Intermittent** — budget many repetitions, not one. ~2 minutes per run. `CRATONVM_DBG_JIT_ROOTSCAN=1` prints one line per
collection (`precise_only` / `incomplete` / `scan_added`), which is what
distinguishes "the scan was skipped" from "the scan ran and found nothing" — the
distinction that took the G1 case three wrong hypotheses to get right.

## Not claimed

* Not that it is the same root cause as the G1 bug. Same *signature*, different
  collector, different protection mechanism (generational protects by not moving,
  G1 by pinning). Treat the shared symptom as a lead, not an identity.
* Not that any particular commit introduced it. The window is ~240 commits and
  nothing has been bisected.
